# :heart: attraction

 This is a game I developed for and submitted to the Ebitengine Game Jam - https://itch.io/jam/ebiten-game-jam

It's a [sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban)-like puzzle game, where you move magnetic pieces (the grey rounded rectangles) in order to collect little brightly-colored gems within a limited number of moves. In honor of Pride Month 2022, the month when I developed this, the colors you collect build one of a set of Pride flags. Celebrate and protect attraction, whether that be magnetism or love, in all its forms.

Press arrow keys to pulse an electromagnet on the corresponding edge of the board: all the magnetic pieces will move one cell in the direction of that magnet if they are able, pushing any moveable pieces along the way.
