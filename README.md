 This is a game I developed for and submitted to the [Ebitengine Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ebiten-game-jam). [Play it](https://ivlivs.itch.io/attraction) on itch.io!

It's a [sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban)-like puzzle game, where you move magnetic pieces (the grey rounded rectangles) in order to collect little brightly-colored gems within a limited number of moves. In honor of Pride Month 2022, the month when I developed this, the colors you collect build one of a set of [Pride flags](https://prideflags.info). Magnetism and love, let's all celebrate, support, and protect identity and  attraction in all their forms.

Press arrow keys to pulse an electromagnet on the corresponding edge of the board: all the magnetic pieces will move one cell in the direction of that magnet if they are able, pushing any moveable pieces along the way.
